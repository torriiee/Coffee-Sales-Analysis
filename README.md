# Excel Coffee Sales Analysis Project

**Description:** Developed an Excel spreadsheet to analyze coffee sales. Data was transferred to the main "Orders" sheet according to specified criteria. The analysis, based on statistical data from 2019-2022, includes customer name, coffee type, roasting type, coffee weight (in kilograms), and information on having a regular customer card or participation in a loyalty program.

**Objective:** Investigate overall sales within a specified timeframe, analyze the level of coffee roasting, check for regular customer card ownership or participation in a loyalty program, and identify the most active customers based on purchase values.

In our dashboard, you will find three main charts:

**1. Total Sales Over Time**

**2. Sales by Country**

**3. Top 5 Customers**
   
The "Total Sales Over Time" chart allows manipulation using the following tools:

â€¢ Slicers:

**1. Roast Type Name**

**2. Loyalty Card**

**3. Size**

Additionally, you can customize the data using the timeline:

**1. Order Date**

# Original Sheet Breakdown

The original sheet was divided into only 3 sheets: Orders, Customers, Products.

In the Orders sheet, not everything was completed. I had to use formulas *(I used INDEX & MATCH)* to transfer data to the respective categories in order to create a complete database.

**1. Orders**
