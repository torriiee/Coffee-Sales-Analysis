# Excel Coffee Sales Analysis Project

**Description:** Developed an Excel spreadsheet to analyze coffee sales. Data was transferred to the main "Orders" sheet according to specified criteria. The analysis, based on statistical data from 2019-2022, includes customer name, coffee type, roasting type, coffee weight (in kilograms), and information on having a regular customer card or participation in a loyalty program.

**Objective:** Investigate overall sales within a specified timeframe, analyze the level of coffee roasting, check for regular customer card ownership or participation in a loyalty program, and identify the most active customers based on purchase values.
